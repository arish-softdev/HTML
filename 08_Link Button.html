                  Kana Arima is a talented but once arrogant child actress from the popular manga and anime series Oshi no Ko. Known for her ability to cry on command and high acting skills, her career waned as she grew older due to her difficult personality. She is now a member of the revived idol group B-Komachi and develops a strong rivalry and friendship with the character Akane Kurokawa. Kana also has a one-sided crush on Aqua Hoshino, a relationship that develops throughout the series.
